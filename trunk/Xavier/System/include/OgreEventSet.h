	\brief
		Class that collects together a set of Event objects.

		The EventSet is a means for code to attach a handler function to some
		named event, and later, for that event to be fired and the subscribed
		handler(s) called.
		\par
		As of 0.5, the EventSet no longer needs to be filled with available events.
		Events are now added to the set as they are first used; that is, the first
		time a handler is subscribed to an event for a given EventSet, an Event
		object is created and added to the EventSet.
		\par
		Instead of throwing an exception when firing an event that does not actually
		exist in the set, we now do nothing (if the Event does not exist, then it
		has no handlers subscribed, and therefore doing nothing is the correct
		course action).
